# Automated Player Tracking

> **Abstract** : The proposed project aims to develop an advanced computer vision system for real-time player tracking, ball detection, and team segregation from sports videos, with a primary focus on football. The system will leverage state-of-the-art object detection and tracking algorithms to accurately identify players and the ball during dynamic gameplay. By employing color-based segmentation techniques, the system will also distinguish between teams based on their t-shirt colors, providing valuable insights into player movements and team strategies.
